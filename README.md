> First the program detects user's face.

> Once the face is detected, It uses that as an input for the trained Deep-learning model.

> That model determines the expression on the face.

> Once the expression is detected, the program then applies selected MASK with detected expreddion on the face.

> As the expression changes, the mask expression also changes.

> Using my hands, I can switch between diffrent mask designs.

> The current mask design is shown in the top of the video frames.

> Using SPACEBAR I can take "screenshots" of the image, which will be stored in "Saved Image" folder.
